# Heap Usage Simulation with SDL

Explore and compare heap memory consumption using two different garbage collection algorithms: Reference Counting and Mark-and-Sweep. This simulation tracks memory allocations, deallocations, and heap usage, providing insights into the behavior of these algorithms.

## Introduction

This project uses the C programming language along with the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) graphics library to simulate and compare two garbage collection algorithms: Reference Counting and Mark-and-Sweep. The objective is to observe and analyze how each algorithm manages heap memory.
